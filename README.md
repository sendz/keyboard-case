## How to order to your local vendor
Find your laser cutter vendor and give them SVG file, or [convert it by yourself to PDF](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/export-pdf.html) first using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) editor, make sure you do double check about the exported dimensions with your vendor, there might be slight difference in micrometer between Inkscape and Corel, better you do a trial run before going to actual production if your vendor utilize different software than Inkscape.
